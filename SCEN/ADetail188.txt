Yesterday, December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, 
the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately 
attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. 
The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused 
severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very 
many American lives have been lost. Yesterday Japanese 
forces also attacked the Philippine Islands and launched an 
unprovoked assault against Malaya. 

Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive 
extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday 
speak for themselves. The people of the United States have 
already formed their opinions and well understand the 
implications to the very life and safety of our Nation. 

As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy I have 
directed that all measures be taken for our defense.

As Supreme Allied Commander, Pacific, you must resist 
Japanese expansion.  The Allied forces at your disposal
are weak at the outset, as the war in Europe has been
given strategic priority.  Hitler must be defeated first.
Until the manufacturing might of the United States can be
harnessed and truly become the "arsenal of democracy", you
must pursue a defensive strategic policy on all fronts.
In time,  offensive operations can commence.  The ultimate
goal...the unconditional surrender of the Empire of Japan.


"Before we're through with 'em, the Japanese language will
be spoken only in Hell!" 

-VADM W.F. Halsey,  December 8th, 1941
