The Japanese surprise attacks of yesterday have left 
the American fleet in Hawaii twisted burning hulks. 
Most of the Hawaiian Airfroce was destroyed on the 
ground. In other areas, a large portion of the Philippine 
airforce has also been destroyed and the Japanese have 
made successful landings in Malaya; at the moment 
they seem unstoppable.

As Supreme Allied Commander, Pacific, you must resist
Japanese expansion.  The Allied forces at your disposal
are weak at the outset, as the war in Europe has been
given strategic priority.  Hitler must be defeated first.
Until the manufacturing might of the United States can be
harnessed and truly become the "arsenal of democracy", you
must pursue a defensive strategic policy on all fronts.
In time, offensive operations can commence.  The ultimate
goal...the unconditional surrender of the Empire of Japan.

As supreme commander of Japan's war machine, you must
seize the "Southern Resources Area" and secure for Japan
the raw materials she requires to pursue her destiny as
the leading Asian nation within the "Greater East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Further, you are required to establish a defensive
perimeter of bases with which to repulse any attempt by
the West to reclaim what is rightfully Japan's.  While 
doing so, crush all opposition.  Japan must be in a
position of strength to withstand the weight of Western
industrial might sure to be brought to bear once the enemy
have recovered from the initial blows.  You must make this
conflict cost prohibitive for the morally weak West and
force the Allied nations to sue for peace, accepting
Japanese territorial gains and Nippon's rise as a world
power.
