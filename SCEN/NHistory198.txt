The Japanese surprise attacks of yesterday have left 
the American fleet in Hawaii twisted burning hulks. 
Most of the Hawaiian Airfroce was destroyed on the 
ground. In other areas, a large portion of the Philippine 
airforce has also been destroyed and the Japanese have 
made successful landings in Malaya; at the moment 
they seem unstoppable.
