Yesterdays surprise attacks against the American 
fleet at Pearl Harbor, the American forces in the 
Philippines and landings on the Malaya pennsula 
have met with nothing short of total success and 
have exceeded even the most opimistic predictions.

As supreme commander of Japan's war machine, you 
must now capitalize on your stunning first day's 
victories and press ahead with the capture the "Southern 
Resources Area" and secure for us the raw materials 
we require to pursue our destiny as the leading Asian 
nation within the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Further, you are required to establish a defensive
perimeter of bases with which to repulse any attempt by
the West to reclaim what is rightfully ours.  While doing
so, crush all opposition.  We must be in a position of
strength to withstand the weight of Western industrial
might sure to be brought to bear once the enemy have
recovered from our initial blows.  We must make this
conflict cost prohibitive for the morally weak West and
force the Allied nations to sue for peace, accepting our
territorial gains and our rise as a world power.

Accepting that it may be a longer war than we hope 
preparations have begun to increase production of key 
aircraft types in readiness for the conflict to come.

Pilot training has secretly been increased and the training 
of a new army begun - construction of additional ships is planned 
from new yards in the Home Islands and stockpiles of strategic minerals
secretly increased - the empire has never been readier for war.

In this war the empire is stronger than ever before but will it be enough !!!

Glory for his Majesty the Emperor and victory for the
Empire of the Sun!

 Banzai!  Banzai!  Banzai!
