While the Japanese regrouped From their defeat on the first landing attempt (DEc 11th 1941), Cunningham and Devereux were called for aid from Hawaii.  Vice Admiral William S. Pye, the Acting Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet, directed Rear Admiral Frank J. Fletcher to take a relief force to Wake.

Centered on the carrier USS Saratoga, Fletcher's force carried additional troops and aircraft for the beleaguered garrison.
 
Moving slowly, the relief force was recalled by Pye on December 22 after he learned that two Japanese carriers were operating in the area. That same day, VMF-211 lost two aircraft. On December 23, with the carrier providing air cover, Kajioka again moved forward. Following a preliminary bombardment, the Japanese landed on the island. Though Patrol Boat No. 32 and Patrol Boat No. 33 were lost in the fighting, by dawn over 1,000 men had come ashore.
