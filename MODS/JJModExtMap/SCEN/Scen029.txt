THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC
The Morning after the Day of Infamy - Quite China

8 December 1941 - 31 March 1946

Yesterday December 7th 1941, the Empire of Japan 
launched its surprise offensive against the possessions 
and armed forces of the western powers all over the 
Pacific reigon. As dawn breaks on the morning of 
December 8th, the Allies tally their losses while the 
Japanese juggernaut continues to roll across the Pacific 
unabated. 

Assume control of either the Japanese or Allied armed
forces in the epic struggle for control of the entire Pacific 
Basin.

Can you do better than either Yamamoto or Nimitz?
