In late November, 1941, negotiations with the Japanese
regarding their "adventure" in China and the resultant
boycott of raw materials to Japan had broken down. War
had become inevitable. As early as November 27, 1941,
war warnings were issued to all commands. VADM Halsey
on "Enterprise" had actually gone a step further and
issued a "shoot to kill" order for his Task Force on the
28th. For all intents and purposes, the USN was at war.

It was expected that the hammer would fall in Southeast
Asia, perhaps the Philippines. Most disturbing, however,
was the disappearance of the units of the Japanese First
Air Fleet from radio intercepts.  Where were they...?

As Supreme Allied Commander, Pacific, you must resist 
Japanese expansion.  The Allied forces at your disposal
are weak at the outset, as the war in Europe has been
given strategic priority.  Hitler must be defeated first.
Until the manufacturing might of the United States can be
harnessed and truly become the "arsenal of democracy", you
must pursue a defensive strategic policy on all fronts.
In time,  offensive operations can commence.  The ultimate
goal...the unconditional surrender of the Empire of Japan.


"Before we're through with 'em, the Japanese language will
be spoken only in Hell!" 

-VADM W.F. Halsey,  December 8th, 1941
