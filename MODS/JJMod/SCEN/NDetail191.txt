16 Dec 1941 - 27 Dec 1941

USN relief attempt

This scenario is historical, the forces involved and the timing of task force sailings are all accurate.

There is one historical change however that allows this battle to take place.

Namely, it is assumed that the change in command at Peal Harbor does not result in the delay in orders of the US Naval task forces - after they sailed, allowing the forces to go forward to the relief of Wake Island as originally planned.

Had that delay not occurred, the first carrier vs carrier battle in history would have been at Wake Island in Dec 1941, instead of at the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942.
