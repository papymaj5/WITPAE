The Japanese surprise attacks of yesterday have left 
the American fleet in Hawaii twisted burning hulks. 
Most of the Hawaiian airforce was destroyed on the 
ground. In other areas, a large portion of the Philippine 
airforce has also been destroyed and the Japanese have 
made successful landings in Malaya; at the moment 
they seem unstoppable.

The abilities of the Japanese have been greatly 
underestimated and the Allies find themselves 
outnumbered and out classed, but help is on the 
way. The Americal industrial machine has been
unleashed but the Allies must buy time until the 
ships, planes and other weapons of war start to 
appear in numbers.

The Allied command had decided on a Germany First 
policy which means that Pacific commanders will have 
to get by with only a small portion of total Allied 
production.
